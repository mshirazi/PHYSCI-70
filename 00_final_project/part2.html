    <h3>The Pasta Machine II: The More Advanced Plans</h3> 
    </div>
    <div class="column-lg">
    
    <p>This week, I focused on getting a more precise model in my drawings and Fusion 360, so that I would be able to 3D print some parts and have them mailed in time. I had to finally figure out the horizontal moving mechanism that I had glossed over in earlier iterations, as well as how to actually put all of my pieces together.</p>
    <img src="./part_2/updatedplans.png" class="img-responsive margin" style="width: 100%">
    <p>I also updated the Fusion file to make it a little more realistic, but it still doesn't have either of the motors on it. </p>
    <img src="./part_2/left.png" class="img-responsive margin" style="width: 100%">
    <img src="./part_2/right.png" class="img-responsive margin" style="width: 100%">
    <p>I then started sketching out the 3D printed pieces, since those needed to be designed asap!</p>
    <img src="./part_2/3dprint.png" class="img-responsive margin" style="width: 100%">
    <p>I also went on a trip to the hardware store, and got a couple pieces in order to make the horizontal motion mechanism. The motion is essentially driven by the movement of a nut on a screw as the screw turns. Essentially, it begins with a 3/8" carriage bolt which will rest in the roller, but in a way that the roller can rotate independently from the carriage bolt. The carriage bolt is then screwed into a shaft set collar, with ID = 5/8", OD = 1-1/8", and width = 9/16". Then, a 1/4" hex nut is fixed into the collar by screwing the carriage bolt tight, and a 1/4" carriage bolt is screwed into that hex nut. Finally, a screw expander is screwed onto the end of the 1/4" carriage bolt and on the other end, the motot is attached by fixing a cotter pin through the the rubber and the hole in the motor shaft. This way, rotation of the motor will drive horizontal motion of the roller.</p>

    <img src="./part_2/angle.jpg" class="img-responsive margin" style="width: 100%">
    <p>This mechanism is paralleled on both sides, so I wanted to use identical motors to try to make the calibration as easy as possible. This meant that I had to use the DC geared motor I planned to use to drive the rollers earlier on, and decided to use a stepper for that instead, on Rob's suggestion.</p>
    <p>Now it was time to figure out the exact measurements of the gear mechanism. Now that I had switched to the stepper motor, I didn't need to have the gears on the side that drove the fixed motor, since the stepper's speed is already pretty low and could generate enough torque (hopefully) without the conversion. I worked on hooking up the stepper motor driver (since when I tried using the h-bridge, things went weird and the stepper would randomly stall and start just vibrating without rotating. I'm not sure it was the fault of the h-bridge, but I thought I might as well use the proper board.)</p>
    <p>I worked mainly off of the example <a href="https://roberthart56.github.io/SCFAB/SC_lab/Output_Devices/SAMD11_stepper/index.html">here (on Rob's page),</a> but I had to change the code a bit to make it do what I wanted it to do. The main thing to figure out was how to do speed control in the way I wanted it.</p>

<p>I realized that essentially the speed was controlled by the delay in the driver board code, and so I needed to have my board communicate an integer for the speed which would then get translated into a delay. I noticed that delays from 2s to 20s spanned the range of speeds that I wanted the stepper to go at (1s isn't enough, and 20s is very slow.) I decided to just use wire transmission, and this way I could even communicate bi-directionality and speed in the same byte, which made things a lot easier.</p>
