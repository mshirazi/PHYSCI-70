  <h3>Final Project Proposition</h3> <br> 
  <div class="row">
    
      <p>For my final project, I wanted to make something that would incorporate a lot of physical fabrication with some digital aspects. I'm not very sure at all of what I would like to do, but I was thinking one of a couple of things:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>A clip that would attach to a plant pot and monitor when you should water your plants (either by counting down the days or by monitoring the soil humdity, if that's even possible?)</li>
        <li>I was also thinking of trying to make a pen that, using some sort of location and motion sensors, would be able to sense what you are writing and redraw it digitally, no matter what you are using it with or on.</li>
        <li>My final idea was to make some sort of little robot whose only ability would be to get back up when you knock it over!</li>
      </ul>
