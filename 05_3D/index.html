  <h3>Week 5: 3D Design & Printing </h3> <br> 
  <div class="row">
    <p>This week, we worked on 3D design. We tried out some scanners in class, and actually found that an iPhone scanner (which wasn't technically a scanner since it used the iPhone X's depth perception) had a much better result than the hand scanners, which would often induce weird results due to <a href= "https://bastiaanvanhengel.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/arduino_projects_book.pdf"> Arduino Projects Book</a>.</p>
    <p>I mainly followed the motorized pinwheel instructions, as well as some instructions on transistors from the <a href= "https://roberthart56.github.io/SCFAB/SC_lab/Output_Devices/FET/index.html">course website.</a></p>

    <p>This helped me figure out on our transistors which parts were the drain, source and ground. I then hooked up the circuit like in the project book, using a generator instead of a battery. I also included the diode, which is put in backwards, to protect the circuit since the motor generates a backwards current that can damage the circuit.</p>

    <p>The code I used was rather simple. I had some issues connecting the board to my computer, but I eventually figured out that it was a problem with the board and not with my laptop, and when I switched it out for another board, everything went well.</p>
    <pre><code class="language-arduino">
    const int switchPin = 2; //keep track of pins (digital)
    const int motorPin = 9;
    int switchState = 0; //keep track of the switch

    void setup() {
      // put your setup code here, to run once:
      pinMode(motorPin, OUTPUT);
      pinMode(switchPin, INPUT);
    }

    void loop() {
      // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
      switchState = digitalRead(switchPin);
      if (switchState == HIGH) {
        digitalWrite(motorPin, HIGH);
      }
      else {
        digitalWrite(motorPin, LOW);
      }
    }
