  <h3>Week 5: 3D Design & Printing </h3> <br> 
  <div class="row">
    <p>This week, we worked on 3D design. We tried out some scanners in class, and actually found that an iPhone scanner (which wasn't technically a scanner since it used the iPhone X's depth perception) had a much better result than the hand scanners, which would often induce weird results when the same part was scanned twice, but incomplete when it was only scanned once. </p>
