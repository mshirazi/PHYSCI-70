  <h3>Week 4: Arduino Programming </h3> <br> 
  <div class="row">
    <p>This week, I continued on my gear journey. I wanted to find a way to hook up sensors to my gear, to give the user control over the gear turning on and over the speed. </p>
    <p>I began by hooking up a basic capacitance sensor to my circuit. At first, I was a little concerned about being electrocuted, but Victoria assured me there was nothing to fear up to 50V, and so I valiantly treked on. I had a bit of trouble making it work in my circuit, but I eventually figured out that I had to hook my circuit up to a generator for my capacitance sensor to work, and that it wouldn't just work off of the power that my computer supplied.</p>
    <img src="./circuit.jpg" class="img-responsive margin" style="width: 50%">
    <p>I also ran into a weird situation, where the pressing ground would only work when I was standing on the metal part of the ground. I think it had something to do with grounding, and for Victoria it only working when she touched the chair.</p>
    <p>The code I used was rather just a modified version of the code from Arduino week. I just changed the condition to be dependent on whether the value of the sensor was greater than 20.</p>
    <pre><code class="language-arduino">
#include <CapacitiveSensor.h>
CapacitiveSensor Sensor = CapacitiveSensor(7,8);

const int switchPin = 2; //keep track of pins (digital)
const int motorPin = 9;
int switchState = 0; //keep track of the switch

void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  pinMode(motorPin, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(switchPin, INPUT);
  Serial.begin(9600);

}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
  long sensorValue = Sensor.capacitiveSensor(300);      //Change the number of samples to get the required timing and sensitivity.
  switchState = digitalRead(switchPin);
  Serial.println(sensorValue);
  
  if (switchState == HIGH || sensorValue > 530) {
    digitalWrite(motorPin, HIGH);
    }
    else {
      digitalWrite(motorPin, LOW);
    }

}
    </code></pre>

    <p>The sensor measures around 50 when I am not touching it, 90 when it is close, 130 for a light touch, and in the 200s when I firmly touch it. I wanted a larger signal to have more precision, however, so I switched from a 1mOhm resistor to a 10mOhm resistor. I also changed my code, to make it change speed as I approached it.</p>
    <pre><code class="language-arduino">

#include <CapacitiveSensor.h>
CapacitiveSensor Sensor = CapacitiveSensor(7,8);

const int switchPin = 2; //keep track of pins (digital)
const int motorPin = 9;
int switchState = 0; //keep track of the switch
int N=1; //number to average
float sensorAve = 0;
int value = 0;

void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  pinMode(motorPin, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(switchPin, INPUT);
  Serial.begin(9600);
  

}

void loop() {
  long int sum = 0;
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
  //for (int i=1; i<N+1; i++){
  int sensorValue = Sensor.capacitiveSensor(200);
  switchState = digitalRead(switchPin);
  value = (log(sensorValue) - 4.5)/5.5*255;
  if (value < 0) {
    value = 0;
  }
  if (value > 255) {
    value = 255;
  }
  analogWrite(motorPin, value);


}
    </code></pre>
    <p>Something I'd like to add on is a calibration period at the beginning, since the values of the capacitance sensor seem to vary a lot.</p>
