  <h3>Week 1: Introduction </h3> <br> 
  <div class="row">
    
      <p>This week, we worked on creating basic ciruits. This was my first time working with a breadboard and an Adafruit Itsy Bitsy, so I focused on just making a basic circuit. I had some trouble at first making the circuit since I got confused about which ways the breadboard was connected. I was trying to make following circuit:</p>

      <p>Once I got the circuit working, I played around with some small variations	in the way the circuit was strung together to see how it affected the circuit. When I removed the resistor, I noticed that the light got a lot brighter. When I measured the voltage around the diode without the resistor, the value was larger than the tension with the resistor. </p>

      <p>The tension measured with the multi-meter around the diode without the resistor was about 3.3V, and with was 2.7V, while the tension around the resistor was 0.6V.</p>
